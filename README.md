The goal is to create a network that performs semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset. This dataset is a large collection of pictures taken from the perspective of a driver in various German cities. Each picture has a corresponding ground-truth image, where each pixel is given a color that corresponds to the class of the object appearing in that pixel. The table below shows the expected input and output of the solution you will be creating.
